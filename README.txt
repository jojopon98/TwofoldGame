Twofold. MVP Controls (only usable with a PS4 controller):

L2 = Fertilize Spell
R2 = Fire Spell

Left Stick = Move
X Button = Jump
Square Button = Interact

For this MVP, I have prepared two levels: a tutorial puzzle for the player and a lock-and-key puzzle.

Level 1:

Hold down the Fertilize Spell button when near an object that can be fertilized to grow the Bellsprout sprite until it hits a max height (which will allow you to use it as a platform). This is the Lawful Solution to this puzzle.
Use the Fire Spell to destroy the leaves on the tree in order to climb the stump. This is the Chaotic Solution to this puzzle.

The main goal is to reach the window.

Level 2:

Hold down the Interact button when colliding with the Buh'ns to "tag" them (turn them green). When all three are tagged, the doors will open and allow you to enter. This is the Lawful Solution to this puzzle.
Use the Fire Spell to kill the Buh'ns. When all three disappear, the doors will open and allow you to appear. This is the Chaotic Solution to this puzzle.

The build to test this on will be called "Twofold MVP Build".
