Level 1:

[LAWFUL SOLUTION] Hold down the Fertilize Spell button when near an object that can be fertilized to grow the Bellsprout sprite until it hits a max height (which will allow you to use it as a platform).
[CHAOTIC SOLUTION] Use the Fire Spell to destroy the leaves on the tree in order to climb the stump.

The main goal is to reach the window.

[CHAOTIC SOLUTION] Use the Fire Spell to kill the Buh'ns. When all three disappear, the doors will open and allow you to appear.

NOTE: The Buhns utilize a Markov model where they will have a set chance of turning before jumping across the screen.

[LAWFUL SOLUTION] Quickly maneuver through the gem-powered defense system.
[LAWFUL SOLUTION] Grow the sprout near the exit to reach it using the Fertilize Spell.

[CHAOTIC SOLUTION] Use the Earthquake Spell button to drop the ceiling crystal, creating a platform to the exit.

Level 4 (1/2 COMPLETE):

[LAWFUL SOLUTION] Use the Light Spell button to turn the stars into platforms that disappear after a few seconds and reach the exit at the top.
[CHAOTIC SOLUTION] Use the Earthquake Spell button to crack the walls and drop a vine down, allowing you to climb up to the exit.
